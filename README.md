# Express App

## How to start
Download as .zip or clone it. 
Please write in command line in cmd for Windows (or equivalent) "npm install". It will install all dependancies (express express-handlebars cookie-parser express-validator mongodb mongoose bcrypt jsonwebtoken). 
After installations write "npx nodemon" to start server. It will have listening on port 3000.
If you want you can change configurations in folder "config". To change database name look for "dbString" in file "database.js".
